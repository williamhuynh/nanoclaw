# Post Critique Checklist

Use this for every post before sending to Will. Don't skip any step.

## Stage 2: Critique Questions

### 1. Relevance Test
- [ ] Why should enterprise risk/governance leaders care about this?
- [ ] Is this their problem or just interesting drama?
- [ ] Does this affect their day-to-day or decision-making?
- [ ] Can I explain the enterprise impact in one sentence?

**Red flags:**
- "This is interesting because..." (not relevant enough)
- "AI labs should care about this..." (wrong audience)
- "This could maybe affect..." (too vague)

### 2. Objection Test
- [ ] What's the obvious pushback or "so what?"
- [ ] Can I defend this claim against skepticism?
- [ ] Am I making logical leaps that don't hold up?
- [ ] Have I tested the weakest link in my argument?

**Example objections to anticipate:**
- "But I don't use that vendor"
- "That's not my problem"
- "So what should I do about it?"
- "This doesn't apply to my industry"

### 3. Insight Test
- [ ] Am I offering a unique POV or just commenting?
- [ ] What's the distinctive insight only Will could offer?
- [ ] Is this based on real patterns from enterprise work?
- [ ] Would someone else write basically the same post?

**Red flags:**
- Generic takes everyone else is making
- Pure news summary without analysis
- Theory without connection to practice
- Repeating what's in the press release

### 4. Action Test
- [ ] Can readers do something with this insight?
- [ ] Is there a governance/operational implication?
- [ ] Does this help them think differently or make decisions?
- [ ] Is the "so what" clear?

**Good outcomes:**
- "I should assess my vendor's security posture"
- "We need to measure AI fluency in our teams"
- "This is why our governance framework isn't working"

### 5. Voice Test
- [ ] Does this sound like Will? (professional + provocative)
- [ ] Am I being too salesy or too generic?
- [ ] Is the opening hook strong and specific?
- [ ] Do I use his pattern phrases? ("The real issue is...", "What's surprised us...")

**Voice checklist:**
- Stats or concrete facts (not vague claims)
- Challenges assumptions or conventional wisdom
- Based on real experience, not theory
- Pragmatic tone (what actually works vs. what sounds good)
- Subtle authority (we've done this, not we think this)

## Common Failure Modes

### Skip or Pivot If:

**"Interesting but not relevant"**
- News is dramatic but doesn't impact enterprise users
- Example: Anthropic distillation attack → "Not my problem" pushback
- Fix: Pivot to adjacent angle (trust erosion, vendor risk) or skip

**"Generic commentary"**
- You're just summarizing news without unique insight
- Anyone could write the same thing
- Fix: Add distinctive POV from Will's experience or skip

**"Forced connection"**
- Trying too hard to make irrelevant news relevant
- Logic doesn't hold up under scrutiny
- Fix: Skip and wait for better story

**"Theory without practice"**
- Abstract discussion without operational grounding
- No clear "so what" for practitioners
- Fix: Add concrete examples or implications

## Decision Tree

```
Is this relevant to enterprise risk/governance teams?
  └─ NO → Skip or pivot to adjacent angle
  └─ YES → Continue

Can I defend against obvious objections?
  └─ NO → Revise logic or skip
  └─ YES → Continue

Is this a distinctive insight (not generic)?
  └─ NO → Skip or find unique angle
  └─ YES → Continue

Is there a clear "so what" for readers?
  └─ NO → Clarify implications or skip
  └─ YES → Continue

Does this match Will's voice?
  └─ NO → Revise tone/structure
  └─ YES → Send to Will
```

## Examples of Good Critique

**Example 1: Anthropic Distillation Attack**

❌ Initial angle: "Bad models will show up in your vendor stack"
🤔 Objection test: "But I don't have to use those vendors"
✅ Revised angle: "Trust erosion in AI vendor ecosystem"

**Example 2: AI Fluency Index**

❌ Initial angle: "Anthropic released cool research"
🤔 Insight test: "This is just news summary, no unique POV"
✅ Revised angle: "Best AI users aren't the ones who trust it most - they challenge it most"

## Quality Bar

Every post must pass ALL five tests. If it fails any test, either fix it or skip it.

Don't send weak posts just to hit the 3/week target. Will's credibility matters more than consistency.
